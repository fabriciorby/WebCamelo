# WebCamelo
A Java Web Project I made for college, it's a scratch of an e-commerce where you can buy anything and sell anything.
The main goal here was to put in practice everything we've learned in classes, at least the most advanced things.
I used SpringMVC framework to help me here. There is Bootstrap, JavaScript and JSTL also.

It may need Eclipse Java EE, Apache Tomcat and MySQL to run.

## Steps:

 1.  Import the sql file to your MySQL database (I used login:root pw:root, so you may change it at ConexaoBD.java file).
 2.  Import to Eclipse as Maven Project.
 3.  Set the server you would like to run the project (I used Apache Tomcat).
 4.  That's it, run it!
 
Once it's running, you can create your own account and put things to sell.<br>You may also create another account to buy the things you're selling and etc.<br>All the money is at a very fake virtual wallet.

Have fun!
